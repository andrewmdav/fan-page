        <h2>Robotics - The "Playtainment" Your Child Has Been Looking For</h2>
        <section>
            <h3><span id="background">Background on "First"</span></h3>
            <p>The series of "First" competitions represent a way to engage grade-school youth in a positive, challenging, problem-solving experience in robotics. Students of all grade school ages learn the values of teamwork and healthy competition as they engage in engineering projects in a competitive, high-performing environment.</p>

            <h3 id="competition">Competition</h3>
            <p> Teams begin their projects in the fall and complete predefined tasks with various types of robotics . Their solutions are honed throughout the competitive season as they face off against other teams preparing for the same assignment. Teams are arranged locally, usually by city, and competitions are held regionally throughout the Twin Cities. Each team incrementally increases their skill on a given task as they learn from other teams’ strategies and performance decisions. According to the <a href="http://www.hightechkids.org"> MN First Competition Website</a>, the age breakdown is generally as follows: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>First Lego League – 4th to 9th Grade</li>
                <li>First Tech Challenge – 7th to 12th Grade</li>
                <li> Jr First Lego League – Below 4th Grade </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The entire family can enjoy watching their local team develop throughout the season.</p>

            <h3 id="gettingStarted">Getting Started</h3>
            <p>It may seem like a long path to get to the competitive level, but building robots can start very easily at home. Many families develop on basic Lego sets, for children under 6, and then move to more advanced sets. This develops the basic building skills and direction reading required to move into more advanced robotics. As your child progresses, they can begin to build beginning robotic sets like the one seen here for kids 8+:

            <p>Just a few fun photos from a basic robotics set. The story behind the pictures is that the same set made both the car and the bulldozer, giving my son a diverse experience while allowing dad to save a few dollars!

            <h4>Managing Growth</h4>
            <p>While the pictures show "all smiles," it is important to remember that there are times where the instructions can be difficult to navigate for a child, times that call for your patience and support. Try to recognize sections of the project they can do on their own, sections that they can do with help, and sections that they cannot do at all. With these in mind, the project plan can be tailored to your child's ability and attention span. A fun experience can truly be the highest priority.
