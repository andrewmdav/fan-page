            <h3><span class="feature">Background on "First"</span></h3>
            <p class="feature">The series of "First" competitions represent a way to engage grade-school youth in a positive, challenging, problem-solving experience in robotics. Students of all grade school ages learn the values of teamwork and healthy competition as they engage in engineering projects in a competitive, high-performing environment.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Competition</h3>
        <p> Teams begin their projects in the fall and complete predefined tasks with various types of robotics . Their solutions are honed throughout the competitive season as they face off against other teams preparing for the same assignment. Teams are arranged locally, usually by city, and competitions are held regionally throughout the Twin Cities. Each team incrementally increases their skill on a given task as they learn from other teams’ strategies and performance decisions. According to the <a href="http://www.hightechkids.org"> MN First Competition Website</a>, the age breakdown is generally as follows: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>First Lego League – 4th to 9th Grade</li>
            <li>First Tech Challenge – 7th to 12th Grade</li>
            <li> Jr First Lego League – Below 4th Grade </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The entire family can enjoy watching their local team develop throughout the season.</p>
